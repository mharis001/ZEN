# Area Markers

Zeus Enhanced adds the ability to create and edit area markers through Zeus.

### Creating

Area markers can be created by either using the context menu action or by placing the "Create Area Marker" module on the map.
The context menu action is only shown when the menu is opened on the map.

### Editing

The properties of area markers can be changed by double clicking on the center icon of the marker.
This will open a menu which allows you to configure the marker's size, rotation, shape, brush, color, and alpha.

Area markers can be moved by left clicking an dragging on the center icon.

### Deleting

Area markers can be deleted by hovering over the center icon and pressing the <kbd>DELETE</kbd> key.
