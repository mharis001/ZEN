# Context Actions

Zeus Enhanced adds many commonly used Zeus actions to its context menu framework.

Some actions require hovering over the relevant entity when opening the menu, while others work with all currently selected Zeus entities of that type. Furthermore, for quality of life with some actions, the hovered entity when the menu is opened is included in the selected entities.

Since it is not possible to overwrite the "place waypoint on right-click" behavior when AI units are selected in Zeus, the context menu can be opened using both the right mouse button and CBA keybind (default: <kbd>V</kbd>). Additionally, the menu can be disabled or set to keybind only mode using the relevant CBA settings.

Here is a list of these actions and brief descriptions on what they do (and any usage details).
