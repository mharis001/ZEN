# Zeus Enhanced

**Zeus Enhanced**, also known as **ZEN**, is an Arma 3 mod aimed at improving and expanding the functionality of the Zeus real-time editor.

Zeus Enhanced is built with communities who use Zeus as their primary mission making tool in mind by enabling curators with powerful tools to create dynamic scenarios in an efficient manner.

This mod is built using the same foundation and design standards as the ACE3 Project.
Special thanks to the [ACE3 Team](http://ace3mod.com/team.html) for their open source nature and permission to use their systems, without their work this would not be possible.
